- “Christ may be ‘received’ without creating any special love for Him in the spirit of the receiver. The man is ‘saved,’ but he is not hungry or thirsty after God. In fact, he is specifically taught to be satisfied and encouraged to be content with little.”
- “Come near to the holy men and women of the past and you will soon feel the heat of their desire after God. They mourned for Him, they prayed and wrestled and sought for Him day and night, in season and out, and when they had found Him, the finding was all the sweeter for the long seeking.” ~ A.W. Tozer The Pursuit of God (p16)
