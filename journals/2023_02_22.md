	- Notes:
		- Approvals:
		  collapsed:: true
			- NABS process renamed to CRMP (Change Risk Management Process).
			- CRMP process - what are the artifacts, and who provides these artifacts?
			- Need to create a starter-pack that includes all the required artifacts.
			- Flow diagrams per-pattern that we can share (there are 5 patterns).
			- Use [[Mahomed, Aadila A]] as a template, because she's been through the CRMP approval process. #[[Vlok, Ruan R]]
			- We would associate an artifact with a question.
			- Make a data manager a prerequisite for any future engagement.
				- Data managers are directly responsible for managing their data in the cloud.
			- Questionnaire -> Risk Rating (low/medium/high) -> determine the forums you need to go to.
			- Each area should have a Non-Financial Risk (NFR) person.
			- Costs: #[[Vlok, Ruan R]]
				- Egress cost (want to get IRA dedicated express route).
			- Do not create unnecessary copies of data, and use the legitimized copy of the data for free. #[[Petzer, Jason J]]
			- Creating a recovery model based on usage is going to be a nightmare #[[Petzer, Jason J]]
