	- "The soul has eyes with which to see, and ears with which to hear. Feeble they may be from long disuse, but by the life-giving touch of Christ alive now and capable of sharpest sight and most sensitive hearing."
	- O Lord, I desperately desire to have this God-consciousness. I want to see and hear and feel you, the God who is my life and my all. I want you to become to me the Great All, and your presence to become the glory and wonder of my life. Grant to me acute spiritual perception. Grant to me to taste you and see that you are good.
	- Lord make this desire the foremost of all. Kill off and destroy in my heart any and every desire that threatens this one. Place yourself on the highest throne in my heart and my soul, and destroy every other throne that you find on your way there.
	- This is my prayer. This is my request. And I pray it in light of your promises to hear and grant our requests if we pray it in your name and according to your will. I believe with everything in me that everything I have asked for is within your will, according to your name, and within your almighty power to grant to me.
	- But nevertheless - if there be some fault in my thinking or my faculties - your will be done, and not mine, Father.
	- I pray this in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, who bled and died for the ransom that was due for my freedom.
	- Amen.
