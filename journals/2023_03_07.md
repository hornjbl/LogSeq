	- “The notions about God are many and varied, but they who hold them have one thing in common: they do not know God in personal experience. The possibility of intimate acquaintance with Him has not entered their minds. While admitting His existence they do not think of Him as knowable in the sense that we know things or people. Christians, to be sure, go further than this, at least in theory. Their creed requires them to believe in the personality of God, and they have been taught to pray, ‘Our Father, which art in heaven.’ Now personality and fatherhood carry with them the idea of the possibility of personal acquaintance.” (p41)?
	- Father, I thank you for this revelation - that you can be known as much as I can know any other physical person or thing. I pray that you will open my spiritual eyes. Help me to experience you, to know you, to behold your beauty and your glory, so that I will fall in love with you as I should be. Forgive my spiritual blindness. I pray that you will cure me of it, like Jesus cured the blind man who wanted to see. I believe that you are capable of giving me spiritual sight. Restore my spiritual senses to what they were supposed to be. Make me see your glory, and hunger and thirst for it more than ever before. In Jesus' name I pray this. Amen.
