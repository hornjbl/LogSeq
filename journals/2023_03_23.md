	- "Then the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, 'Samuel! Samuel!' And Samuel said, 'Speak, for Your servant is listening." (1 Sam 3:10)
	- Father, I thank you that you have spoken to us through the Word. That this is not a dead book, with words that you have once spoken, but that it is living and active, and that it speaks to us even now. That it speaks to ME even now.
	- Teach me to listen. Teach me to hear.
	- Cure me of my spiritual deafness, and help me to clearly hear you speak to me through your Word. I long to listen to you speak, and then to speak to you in turn through prayer.
	- Drown out the noise of this world, of my flesh, of the physical things and literal audible sounds, and help me to hear you as clearly as I head any living person speak to me.
	- Thank you for books like these, that help me think through these things. Help me to not become complacent and bored with its contents, and to continue to have a passion and a zeal for your things.
	- Enlarge my heart and my mind concerning you, and let my changed life shout the declaration of these things.
	- In Jesus' name. Amen
