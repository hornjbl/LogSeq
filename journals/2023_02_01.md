	- Righteousness given to all through Christ.
	- God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement.
	- Christ paid the penalty for the sin we all commit.
	- Trust in Christ and what He has done for you.
	- When you doubt that you have this grace, you are thinking more about yourself and your sin than you are thinking about Christ, what He has done, and His grace.
	- Grace must not just be a topic we discuss, but a power we use and appropriate.
	- God's gift of grace is the power to obey.
	- Forgiving grace.
	- Transforming grace.
